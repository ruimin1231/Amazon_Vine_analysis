# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The puprose analysis was to see if it is worth subscribing to the vine program.

## Results
The results seemed pretty low and not worth enrolling in the program. if you look at the results below there were only 15 paid 5 star reviews and 23,733 unpaid 5 star reviews.

## Summary
It does not look like there is a positivity bias for the Vine program here because the outcome was so low in comparision to the total amount. another analysis that would have been helpful would be to see what other categories rated with getting 5-star reviews to see if this is higher than the mean of all 5 star reviews.
